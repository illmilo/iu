# I. Kleene Star
**Kleene star** is a **unary operator** \* that applies to a set of symbols or a set of strings. It is also called **free monoid** on a set.
If $\textbf{A}$ is an **alphabet**, then $\textbf{A}^*$ is the **set of all strings over symbols in A**, including **empty string** $\epsilon$.
*Example:* $\textbf{B}=\{0,1\}\implies \textbf{B}^* =\{\epsilon,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,001,â€¦\}$
- A **monoid** is a **set** equipped with an **associative binary operation** and an **identity element**.
- The **free monoid** on a set is the monoid whose elements are **all finite sequences of zero or more elements from that set.**
*String concatenation* is the **monoid operation**.
